    Results of a time-of-flight simulation used to create a lookup table.

    The results (apart from ``distance``) should be flat lists (1d arrays) of length N

    simulation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time_of_arrival:
        Time of arrival of the neutrons at the position where the events were recorded
        (1d array of size N).
    speed:
        Speed of the neutrons, typically derived from the wavelength of the neutrons
        (1d array of size N).
    wavelength:
        Wavelength of the neutrons (1d array of size N).
    weight:
        Weight/probability of the neutrons (1d array of size N).
    distance:
        Distance from the source to the position where the events were recorded
        (single value; we assume all neutrons were recorded at the same position).
        For a ``tof`` simulation, this is just the position of the detector where the
        events are recorded. For a ``McStas`` simulation, this is the distance between
        the source and the event monitor.

Note also that the range of total flight paths is supplied manually to the workflow
instead of being read from the input data, as it allows us to compute the expensive part

    Notes
    -----

    Below are some details about the binning and wrapping around frame period in the
    time dimension.

    We have some simulated ``toa`` (events) from a Tof/McStas simulation.
    Those are absolute ``toa``, unwrapped.
    First we compute the usual ``event_time_offset = toa % frame_period``.

    Now, we want to ensure periodic boundaries. If we make a bin centered around 0,
    and a bin centered around 71ms: the first bin will use events between 0 and
    ``0.5 * dt`` (where ``dt`` is the bin width).
    The last bin will use events between ``frame_period - 0.5*dt`` and
    ``frame_period + 0.5 * dt``. So when we compute the mean inside those two bins,
    they will not yield the same results.
    It is as if the first bin is missing the events it should have between
    ``-0.5 * dt`` and 0 (because of the modulo we computed above).

    To fix this, we do not make a last bin around 71ms (the bins stop at
    ``frame_period - 0.5*dt``). Instead, we compute modulo a second time,
    but this time using ``event_time_offset %= (frame_period - 0.5*dt)``.
    (we cannot directly do ``event_time_offset = toa % (frame_period - 0.5*dt)`` in a
    single step because it would introduce a gradual shift,
    as the pulse number increases).

    This second modulo effectively takes all the events that would have gone in the
    last bin (between ``frame_period - 0.5*dt`` and ``frame_period``) and puts them in
    the first bin. Instead of placing them between ``-0.5*dt`` and 0,
    it places them between 0 and ``0.5*dt``, but this does not really matter,
    because we then take the mean inside the first bin.
    Whether the events are on the left or right side of zero does not matter.

    Finally, we make a copy of the left edge, and append it to the right of the table,
    thus ensuring that the values on the right edge are strictly the same as on the
    left edge.
